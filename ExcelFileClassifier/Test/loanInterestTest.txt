2.2 Interest
a) The Borrower Danny Mathew agrees to pay interest at the rate of 10% under schedule II (d) of
this agreement, with the rests mentioned therein. The Borrower understands that the term “MCLR”
means Marginal Cost of Funds based lending rate, which is a tenure linked benchmark, arrived
based on the corresponding tenure of a particular advance/ facility.
The actual lending rate shall be determined by adding the components of Spread to MCLR (of
appropriate tenure). MCLR of different tenures shall be reviewed and published by the Bank on the
1st day of every month. The interest rate in a particular loan account will be changed only on the
Reset date/ period, irrespective of tenure of MCLR or interim changes in the rates of MCLR. The
revised rates (prevailing on the date of reset) shall be made applicable to the loans/ facilities
extended, from the 1st day of the corresponding month of the reset period expiry (for the initial
reset), irrespective of the actual date of availing and subsequent reset shall be on the 1st day of the
corresponding month of reset period fixed.
